# 🖥️ **any.WakeLock** - A Simple Wake Lock API Demo

Welcome to **any.WakeLock**! This project demonstrates how to use the **Screen Wake Lock API** to prevent your device's screen from turning off while your webpage is active.

This lightweight app allows you to experiment with the Wake Lock API and manage screen sleep behavior across different browsers.

## 🌟 **Features**

- 🚀 **Screen Wake Lock**: Keep the screen from going to sleep when active.
- 🌙 **Dark/Light Theme Toggle**: Switch between dark and light mode with ease.
- 🔄 **Auto-Reactivation**: Automatically re-enable the Wake Lock when the tab becomes active again.
- ✅ **Support Check**: The app checks if the browser supports the Wake Lock API and provides feedback.

## 🛠️ **How It Works**

The app uses the **Wake Lock API** to keep the screen awake when the user is actively interacting with the page. When the user clicks the "Turn Wake Lock On" button, the Wake Lock is activated, and the screen will stay on. You can also release the Wake Lock manually by clicking the same button, or it will automatically release when the tab becomes inactive.

Additionally, the app includes:

- A **theme toggle button** for switching between light and dark mode.
- A **checkbox** to automatically re-enable the Wake Lock when the tab becomes active again.
